# haaretz-premium-bypass

I found a hack in Haaretz and themarker. Although their premium articles are locked for non subscribed users, we can use the AMP urls to get the full article.

So this is just a super simple static web page that consumes a url and wrap it with [google amp project](https://developers.google.com/amp) cached articles in order to provide the reader with the full content of haaretz and themarker premium paid article for free (Cause fuck them).
