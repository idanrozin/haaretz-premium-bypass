# haaretz-premium-bypass

## 2022 Update: 
### Unfortunately I have shut down this mini site. as the caching mecahnism of these sites has been changed and it is no longer available to use this work-around :(

I found a hack in Haaretz and themarker. Although their premium articles are locked for non subscribed users, we can use the AMP urls to get the full article.

So this is just a super simple static web page that consumes a url and wrap it with [google amp project](https://developers.google.com/amp) cached articles in order to provide the reader with the full content of haaretz and themarker premium paid article for free (Cause fuck them).

(Best viewed on mobile, cause AMP project is meant for mobile devices)
